	Osgiliath Enterprise Framework facilitate your database migration with
	the help of <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/">Liquibase</a>

			<h2>Usage</h2>
		</header>
		<p>As a reminder, the Model archetype is made of three module: a
			super one that's called model, a database one declaring your database
			and a JPA one declaring your model tables/pojos.</p>
		You first have to change the informations of your production database
		by editing the pom of the model one.
		<p>Then, after you've developed your model (manually editing jpa
			entities) and want to update your production db execute 'mvn clean
			install -Pdb-data' to retrieve all data from the production database
			on a changelog (the resulting xml changelog file will be located on
			the database module).</p>
		<p>Then, you've to retrieve the structural difference between your
			local entities and the production database. Again, execute 'mvn clean
			install -Pdb-diff' on the JPA module to retrieve that structural diff
			(again on an xml located in the database module).</p>
		Then, you've to tweak your datas (the first generated changelog) to
		map with your newer database structure if needed.
		<p>Finally, edit the db-changelog.xml of the database module to
			point to the two precedent xml files and deploy the new feature: your
			database structure and datas will be updated corresponding to your
			changes.</p>

			<h1>Querying all your REST services with Swagger</h1>
		</header>
		<p>If you installed the osgiliath-business feature, you'll have
			access to an administration console to query your web services.</p>
		First, you have to annotate your model element as well as your
		services with <a href="https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger">swagger</a>
		annotations (<a
			href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/swagger-make-developers-love">here
			are a useful tutorial</a>). You then will have access to the Swagger UI
		interface via http://&lt;yourhost&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/api-docs. On
		Swagger UI, you finally have to reference your server URL (i.e.
		http://localhost:8181/myServiceServer/api-docs).
