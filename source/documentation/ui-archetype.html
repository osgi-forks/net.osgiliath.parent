<H1>The UI framework</H1>
</header>
The UI framework is mainly base on the Yeoman framework so I encourage you to see this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1fvdO9GY">video</a>

The addition is that you can use maven (mvn clean install) on it :) and that it contains a websocket service (that will be catched by JMS and so the routes or business modules).

Note that when you'll run the bundle in Karaf, the context url will be equal to the WebApp-Context and Web-ContextPath section of the osgi.bnd file.
