<H1>Goal</H1>

The parent archetype is defined to be the root of all nested modules (generated by the others archetypes).

Your first step in the Osgiliath programming world is to generate a project based on this archetype, you will then be able to generate modules of the generated project with the other Osgiliath archetypes (or nested parent ones).

<H2>Feature declaration</H2>
A parent project defines more or less an application, or a big feature you want to provide.
In order to put your entire project in production environment in a single command, you've to describe a xml describing all the modules that must be deployed to make the application up and running.
A <a href="http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/users-guide/provisioning.html" target="_blank">feature</a> can be split into multiple subfeatures allowing you to either deploy partial app (i.e. in case of upgrade) or test a subset of your project (i.e.: you don't have to deploy your entire app to test the exposed web services).

<a href="https://github.com/OsgiliathEnterprise/net.osgiliath.parent/blob/master/net.osgiliath.samples/net.osgiliath.hello/net.osgiliath.hello.features/src/main/resources/net.osgiliath.hello.features.xml" target="_blank">Here</a>'s a sample feature.xml declaration.

<H2>Property declaration</h2>

You can also define properties that will be consumed by our applications, in order to do this, a cfg file is provided on the feature module.

Properties are defined in the key/value form
